For adding custom implementation: (Shown with custom implementation of random policy)

1. Add name of the algorithm in the enum class.
2. Import that into Cache.h file.
3. Implement the <algorithm>EvictionPolicy.h file and inherit from EvictionPolicy class and add all the functions for that class.
4. Done! Whenever want to use, call with that EvictionPolicy

For running:
Compile: g++ *.cpp
Run: ./a.out

For running with different Eviction Policies, just change, the enum name for the relevavnt Policy in the cache object declaration:

Eg: For this: Cache<int, int> cache(capacity, EvictionPolicyType::FIFO);

If want to run with LRU: just change FIFO -> LRU, the object would like this: Cache<int, int> cache(capacity, EvictionPolicyType::LRU);
